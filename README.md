## Ghibli Rec Hub - https://ghibli-rec-hub.netlify.app/


Studio Ghibli is a well known studio that produces well known anime movies. This application recommends the user a random Studio Ghibli film to watch

As of November 2022 this project is no longer able to recommend a film due to the fact the API used is no longer working due to Heroku's free tier being discontinued.

## Technologies Used: Javascript, HTML CSS
My goal for this project was to become familiar with using a fetch API and to return the information to the user.

## Lessons Learned:
I was able to use a fetch API to return data and visualize how it can interact with the DOM.
